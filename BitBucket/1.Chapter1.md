## Step 1. Clone your repository to your local system
````Shell
$ git clone

https://emmap1@bitbucket.org/emmap1/bitbucketstationlocations.git 

Cloning into 'bitbucketspacestation'...
fatal: could not read
Password for 'https://emmap1@bitbucket.org': No such file or directory
````

If you get this error you need to do something like this 
````Shell
  $ git config --global core.askpass
````

## Step 2. Add a file to your local repository  
- Adding a file
    ````Shell
    $ echo "Earth's Moon" >> locations.txt
    ````
    ````Shell
    $ git status 
    On branch main
    Initial commit
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        locations.txt
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ````

    The file is untracked, meaning that Git sees a file not part of a previous commit. The status output also shows you the next step: adding the file.


- Tell Git to track your new locations.txt 
    ````Shell
    $ git add locations.txt
    ````
    The `git add` command moves changes from the working directory to the Git staging area. The staging area is where you prepare a snapshot of a set of changes before committing them to the official history.

- Check the status of the file.
    ````Shell
    $ git status 
    On branch main
    Initial commit
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file: locations.txt
    ````
- Commit the changes
    ````Shell
    $ git commit -m 'Initial commit' 
    [main (root-commit) fedc3d3] Initial commit
      1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
      create mode 100644 locations.txt
    ````
    The `git commit` takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with `git add`, this process defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
